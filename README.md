# Analysis of Sant√©-Travail questionnaire from the UEP (administered November/December 2022)  

## You need to place several files into the "data/Initial datasets/" folder  
### from the "Bases_for_sharing" folder in the shared drive  
"2023-09-20-1819_ALLincsVs0123_ALLparticipants.rds"  
"2023-02-02-1137_SanteTravail_ALLparticipants.rds"

### From Gaelle via Nick (in "Pour_Anshu" folder)  
*These two are only used for the flow diagram and non-response analyses*  
"Q_sante_travail_21022023.csv"  
"Q_sante_travail_21022023_refparents_SEROCOVKIDS.csv"  

**First run the three 01_prep files in sequence (a,b,c) to generate the datasets used for nearly all downstream analyses (these are placed into data/Generated datasets/)**  

**You should also install the pacman package (package management tool) for automatic installing / loading of all packages used in these analyses.**
